# Stay on Track Web Application

The Stay on Track web application will allow users decide on the types of task 
they wish to be reminded of, that way if it does not apply to them it would not
clutter the interface. Users will be able to categorize tasks using labels and 
illustrated icons. The user will be able to mark specific tasks with different 
levels of urgency and the ability to mark if the deadline for said task is 
flexible or concrete. The web application will include different icon statuses 
to show visual progression of the tasks. For example, if maintenance is
continuously pushed off, the appliance icon will change to have a broken 
appearance. The web application will include a to-do list of recommended tasks
based on deadline and urgency. The web application theme will also be 
customizable with color themes.

## Compile/Deploy

The application will be deployed to a hosting website, Fly.io.
