Problem Statement
-----------------

When it comes to productivity and task trackers they are usually designed for 
students and are not suited to keeping track of life related tasks that do not 
occur frequently. When one is busy with responsibilities it can be difficult to 
keep track of appointments, deadlines, maintenance, and other non-regular 
day-to-day chores. 

If important dates are not kept track of, it can leave people rushing to complete
important things like filing taxes to the last minute. If consistent 
appointments are not maintained it could result in a decline in health or
health conditions remaining untreated. If maintenance of appliances or vehicles
is left uncompleted; it could result in serious damage. For example, if a dryer
vent is left blocked; it could result in a fire. 

A solution to maintaining organized list of non-frequent and important 
life-related tasks is the Stay on Track web application. Users will be able to 
set recurring reminders of appointments, maintenance, deadlines, expiration dates
of licenses/tags, and other non-frequent chores.

Project Description
-------------------

The Stay on Track web application will allow users decide on the types of task 
they wish to be reminded of, that way if it does not apply to them it would not
clutter the interface. Users will be able to categorize tasks using labels and 
illustrated icons. The user will be able to mark specific tasks with different 
levels of urgency and the ability to mark if the deadline for said task is 
flexible or concrete. The web application will include different icon statuses 
to show visual progression of the tasks. For example, if maintenance is
continuously pushed off, the appliance icon will change to have a broken 
appearance. The web application will include a to-do list of recommended tasks
based on deadline and urgency. The web application theme will also be 
customizable with color themes.

Personal Motivation
-------------------

As someone who is often busy with university and life, I understand how 
challenging keeping track of important life tasks and appointments can be. I 
use a student planner to keep track of assignments, however, I noticed it did
not work for adding other important life related tasks. If a task it too far out
I often will forget about it. I found that being organized improves keeping 
track of important tasks which is why I want to create this web application. It 
would prove useful to others who also want to stay on track and help them become
less overwhelmed and improve their quality of life.
