### Product

- **Product Name:** Stay On Track Web Application

### Project Description

The Stay on Track web application will allow users to 
set up recurring tasks of different intervals (ex: monthly, 6 months, yearly). 
Users can organize tasks by categories and will be able to mark  tasks with 
different levels of urgency and the ability to mark if the deadline for said 
task is flexible or concrete. The dashboard will display tasks in different 
sections: Overdue, Upcoming, and Completed. The web application will include 
different icon statuses to show visual progression of the tasks. For example, 
if maintenance is continuously pushed off, the appliance icon will change to 
have a broken appearance.

USER-ACCEPTANCE TEST
--------------------

### User-Acceptance Test Strategy
The user acceptance testing will be performed by having users test specific 
features by following steps. The steps will be general to determine if the 
interface is intuitive. The users will be observed as they perform the test. 
User surveys will be used to receive feedback and gain measurable rating of 
specific qualities, such as ease of use. Feedback will be utilized to identify 
useability issues, errors, and areas of improvement.
